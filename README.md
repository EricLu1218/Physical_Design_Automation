# Physical Design Automation
This is "2019 NTHU CS613500 VLSI Physical Design Automation" course project.

## Notice 
Each code has been modified to OOP, so it's not the same as its report.

If you want to run it, please read README in src/.

## Homework2: Two-way Min-cut Partitioning
Implement Fiduccia–Mattheyses algorithm to solve the problem of two-way min-cut partitioning.

## Homework3: Fixed-outline Slicing Floorplan Design
Implement Stockmeyer algorithm to solve the fixed-outline floorplan design with a set of hard blocks.

## Homework4: Placement Legalization
Implement an existing algorithm, called “Abacus”, to legalize a given global placement result with minimal displacement.

## Homework5: Global Routing
Implement an existing algorithm to solve the global routing problem with a set of 2-pin nets while minimizing the total wirelength.
